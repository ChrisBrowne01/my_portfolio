    *Due to the nature of following the objectives for this project, the requiremnts were to use the coding coding languages:* ***HTML, CSS and JavaScript.***/
    *For this reason I decieded not to stray too far by using libraries such as, W3.CSS, jQuery, or Bootstrap, which I am quite familer with. Instead I have choosen to show my understandings and skills of a coder by extracting and manipulating code from these libraries into standard HTML, CSS and JavaScript format, to my own design.*
